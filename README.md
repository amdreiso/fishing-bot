<h1>Cruelty Squad Fishing Bot</h1>

###

<p>this is a very bad piece of code alright use at your own risk it may delete everything you have or will ever have.</p>

<h3>dependencies: </h3>

<ul>
<li>pyautogui</li>
</ul>

```sh
pip3 install pyautogui
```

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lower you gamma to around 40</li>
<li>Turn your mouse sensitivity all the way down (no movement allowed)</li>
<li>Lower your FOV so there's less pixels on the screen (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>lowering the gamma should do it, but if the fish is still undetectable the target color can be changed in code, if you're really that down bad</p>
